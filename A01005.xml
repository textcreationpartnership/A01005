            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

How then is not Apoſtolicall tradition a principle <hi>proper to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but common to all men?</hi> You will ſay, Infidels alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the tradition of their Anceſtours, and ſo tradition is a principle which Chriſtians haue common with them. I anſwere in like manner, Infidels belieue the Scriptures and writings of their anceſtours; will you then ſay, that Apoſtolicall Scripture is not a principle proper to Chriſtians, but common to all men? If not, I hope then you will eaſily vnderſtand, that though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane tradition be a principle with Infidels, yet Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall tradition may be, &amp; is a principle proper to Chriſtians.</p>

                        <hi>The contrary beliefe</hi> may be concerning points, wherein Scripture may with ſo great probability be alleaged on both ſides, that true louers of God and truth, may without any fault ſome goe one way, and ſome another, and ſome (and thoſe as good as either of the former) ſuſpend their iudgement and expect ſome <hi>Elias</hi> to reconcile the repugnancies; Now reaſon cannot but feele much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and repugnance, to belieue a book full of ſeeming contradictions to be <hi>the word of God,</hi> and to containe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but infallible truth.</q> And yet all true Chriſtians (and you profeſſe with them) do vpon the authority of Tradition belieue <hi>Scripture</hi> to be Gods word, &amp; euery word &amp; ſillable thereof to be infallible truth, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the ſeeming contradictions, which moſt of Chriſtians know not how to compoſe, <hi>but must expect ſome Elias to reconcile them: Ergo</hi> they hold (and you profeſſe to hold) Tradition as a Principle aboue reaſon, and ſo high in authority aboue it, as it is able to command reaſon to belieue, what to the ſeeming of reaſon cannot poſſibly be true. Thus by your owne contradictions the reſolution of faith, that Scriptures be the word of God, is conuinced to reſt finally not on Reaſon, but on Tradition, a Principle ſuperiour to all human Reaſon.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. TO the conſtitution of an aſſent abſolutely infallible, fiue thinges concurre, all which by the conſent of Catholique Deuines are moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and infallible in the aſſent of Chriſtian faith. 1. The <hi>Obiect,</hi> with is doctrine reuealed of God. 2. The <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,</hi> and reaſon of belieuing which is the Authority of God reuealing whoſe veracity is altogether infallible. 3. Becauſe we belieue <hi>Reuelations</hi> not made immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly to our ſelues, but to the bleſſed Apoſtles, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary there be a <hi>Proponent</hi> of Gods word, that is a <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> worthy of all credit, an Authority whereon we may ſecurely rely, that thoſe Chriſtian doctrines were deliuered and preached by the <hi>Apostles</hi> as Diuine Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. This <hi>Proponent</hi> and <hi>Witneſſe</hi> is the preſent Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, deliuering what ſhe receaued by full vniuerſall tradition from her Anceſtours, or (which is the ſame in effect) <hi>vniuerſall Tradition.</hi> Now we hold tradition to be altogether as infallible as Scripture, and that it ought to be receaued with the ſame reuerence, with the ſame ſubmiſſiue deuotion of pious beliefe, as Scripture, as you acknowledge that we do. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Fourthly, that an aſſent be infallible it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that the thing belieued, be repreſented and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Vnderſtanding of the belieuer in <hi>ſuch manner,</hi> as he may know the ſame to be infallible, and that in belieuing it, he cannot poſſibly erre. For the <hi>manner</hi> of belieuing, if it be not knowne to the belieuer to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, though it be infallible in it ſelfe, will not make him ſure and infallible. This condition is found in the aſſent of Chriſtian fayth; for the things to be belieued are repreſented as cleer by noted and marked <hi>with diuine
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2514:26"/>and ſupernaturall proofes,</hi> that is, confirmed with innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable manifeſt miracles, which the belieuers haue ſeen with their eyes, or elſe know them by the report of whole worlds of thoſe that beheld them, by report ſo full conſtant &amp; brim as it is equiualent to the euidence of ſenſe. Theſe Diuine proofes and markes euidently ſhew, that the things marked with them, are vnder the ſpeciall care of God and of his infinite goodneſſe, that he cannot but prouide, that the pious belieuer be not deceaued about them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Hereby is concluded, that the <hi>Chriſtian manner</hi> of apprehending the myſteries of faith is infallible, &amp; more ſure and certaine then any <hi>manner</hi> of naturall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, and apprehenſion of things can poſſibly be. Naturall knowledge is eyther <hi>Phyſicall,</hi> whereby we apprehend things as true, becauſe repreſented as ſuch by the euidence of ſenſe; or <hi>Metaphyſicall,</hi> whereby we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend things as true, by the light of vnderſtanding, which cleerly beholds the neceſſary connexion the thing apprehended hath with truth. As in this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Euery whole thing is greater then any ſingle part thereof,</hi> our vnderſtanding, by the notion of the ſingle wordes, preſently without diſcourſe ſees and belieues the truth of the ſpeach. Neyther of theſe repreſentations is ſo certaine &amp; infallible, that it implies contradiction that men ſhould be deceaued by it, eyther by ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary working of God to men vnknowne, or through the infinity of the thing apprehended, which men ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not comprehend. For example, men ſee the Chymnies of a Towne ſmoake, thence they conclude with <hi>Phyſicall</hi> certitude, that there is fire in thoſe Chymnies; wherein they may be miſtaken, ſeing God may haue rayſed that ſmoake without any fire. We are better aſſured, by the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2514:26"/>light of vnderſtanding about vniuerſall principles, which appeare manifeſtly true, by the very notion of the ſingle wordes; yet not ſo vniuerſally ſure, but we may be deceaued by them about infinite and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thinges. That Principle I before named, <hi>Euery whole thing is greater then any ſingle part thereof,</hi> we are not ſure thereof in infinite whole thinges; yea many learned men do maintaine, that in an infinite multitude, the whole multitude is not greater then a ſingle part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. That knowne rule and principle of all diſcourſe, <hi>The thinges with be one and the ſame with a third thing, are one and the ſame betweene themſelues,</hi> Fayth aſſures vs, that the ſame fayles in the diuine Nature, which being infinite and incomprehenſible, may be and is identified with three diuine Perſons really diſtinct. Nor is this to deſtroy all certitude of naturall knowledge, but only to make the ſame finite, and limited within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of its weake reach and capacity, infinitly infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to diuine wiſdome, and altogether ſubordinate to his moſt infallible word.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Now deception cannot poſſibly happen in our belieuing of doctrines repreſented to our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, cleerly marked with euident miracles and other ſupernaturall notes, ſhewing they are reuealed of God. For God working by his power aboue nature to mooue men to belieue ſuch Diuine and miraculous doctrine, cannot alſo worke aboue nature what may be the cauſe of our deception therein: for then he ſhould be contrary to himſelfe, with is altogether impoſſible Nor can there be feare, danger, or poſſibility, that in this beliefe we may be deceaued through weakneſſe of iudgment, cauſed by the finite capacity of humane wit, becauſe in this beliefe the light of natur all reaſon
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2514:27"/>is not our guide, but the word of God diſcouering high myſteries and hidden ſecrets conforme to his infinite and vndeceiuable vnderſtanding. Hence a late lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Writer our Countryman ſayth excellently to this purpoſe,

                  <p n="6">6. The fifth thing is firme adherence to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine propoſed, ſo that the belieuer cannot at all, or elſe very hardly be driuen from his perſuaſion of the truth thereof. This adherence in Chriſtian Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques is ſo firme, that they are ready not only to giue their life in teſtimony thereof; but alſo will deny their owne ſenſes, their reaſon, and all naturall euidence, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then admit any doubt of doctrine in this manner, repreſented to them as Gods infallible word.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If any obiect, that the aſſent of Chriſtian fayth, is often ſhaken with doubts, ſometimes ouerthrowne; wheras the aſſent of naturall knowledge ſtands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and vnmooued without danger of falling: I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were, this is true, but the reaſon hereof is not becauſe the aſſent of naturall knowledge is more certain and firme of it ſelfe; but becauſe Chriſtian fayth, is more expoſed to the blaſts of temptation. An Oake, on the top of an high mountayne is ſhaken with wind and ſtorme, and many times beaten to the ground; wheras a tender ſprig growing low out of the wind is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to this danger; yet no man will ſay, that the ſprig is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2514:27"/>more firme and deeply rooted in the ground then the Oake. Chriſtian fayth ſtandeth on high hauing for matter and ſubiect, high inuiſible and incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble myſteries, which though they are by the belieuer ſufficiently ſeene to be reuealed of God; yet not ſeene at all by naturall reaſon to be true in themſelues; yea ſtill in themſelues they remaine darke, obſcure, difficill, and ſeemingly impoſſible in humane reaſon. Hence though fayth be firmely grounded, and deeply rooted on the authority of God reuealing Chriſtian doctrines, yet ſtronge apprehenſions of the ſeeming impoſſibility thereof, like violent blaſts cauſe the ſame ſometimes to ſhake &amp; wauer with inuoluntary doubts: whereas the aſſent of naturall knowledge is neuer, or ſeldome tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to doubt, becauſe there is no ſeeming impoſſibility in ſuch truth.

The firſt argument: Chriſtian fayth cannot be ruled and guided to ſaluation, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to heauen without the onely rule, without the onely guide, without the onely meanes. No man in his wits can deny this: Now you ſay, men may attaine by fayth vnto ſaluation without Scripture, though they be wholy ignorant of Scripture (as you truly ſay with vs) yea though they actually reiect Scripture, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to be ruled by it, though the ſame be propoſed to them by the whole Church (as you ſay without vs, and truth:) <hi>Ergo,</hi> Scripture is not the only rule, and meanes of Saluation.</p>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:2514:50"/>if what here you write ſo abſolutly be true, your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that men wholy ignorant of Scripture, yea though they reiect and deny it to be Gods word, may be ſaued, is not only <hi>hereſy damnable in it ſelfe,</hi> but alſo <hi>Hereſy Apostaticall,</hi> ſo abſolutly, and <hi>indiſpenſably destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue of ſaluation,</hi> as no ignorance can excuſe it.

                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. The ſecond argument. If the diuine authority of the Scripture be the only rule and guide of fayth, then it is ſo appointed of God, and God requireth of men, that they ſhould belieue Scripture to be their rule as being his infallible word, &amp; his only doctrine. But you ſay, God requires not, that men belieue the diuine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture, yea they may reiect this light and the direction therof, without doing againſt any diuine ordinance, or appointment: How then is Scripture the only rule of fayth, the only meanes and way to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation? except you will ſay it is the rule appointed not of God, but by your ſelfe, &amp; the deep wiſdome of your excellent wit.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2514:51"/>written in Scripture, as the Being taught by the Church, is the rule to know which is the Chriſtian Doctrine, and to belieue it. For the <hi>Being</hi> propoſed and taught externally <hi>is requiſit not to the well being only,</hi> but to <hi>the very being of Chriſtian Doctrine;</hi> becauſe it cannot be credible, and fit to be belieued of Chriſtian men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be externally propoſed and taught them to be of God by ſome credible witneſſe. But the <hi>Being</hi> taught, <hi>which is ſo much of the being of Chriſtian Doctrine,</hi> is not the <hi>being</hi> taught in Scripture: <hi>For this is requiſit but to the well being therof,</hi> as you ſay. <hi>Ergo,</hi> beſides being written and taught by Scripture, another external <hi>being</hi> taught is requiſite, which is of the very eſſence of Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which makes the ſame credible, and fit to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued, and this can be no other but the <hi>Being</hi> taught by the Church of Chriſt, <hi>the pillar and ground of truth.</hi> So that the rocke, the ſolid, firme, ſubſtantiall reaſon of belieuing Chriſtian Doctrine, is the <hi>Being</hi> taught by the Church; and the <hi>Being</hi> written in Scripture is requiſit <hi>ad melius eſse,</hi> to the well being thereof, becauſe we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue it better, and more aſſuredly when we find that which is taught by the Church to be alſo written in Scripture, though this be not abſolutly neceſſary to the conſtitution of Chriſtian Doctrine.

For if Chriſt Ieſus be the true God conſubſtantiall to his father, then Heretiques, to wit <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Arian</hi> Proteſters againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> cannot be ſaued by Chriſt, ſeeing they refuſe to belieue and worſhip him as the true God.

Wherefore, what you ſay, that this ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable allegation of Scriptures on both ſides is a ſure ſigne of a poynt not neceſſary, implies Atheiſme, to wit, that it doth not import Chriſtians to know whether in worſhipping Chriſt Ieſus as the true God, they be not worſhippers of a falſe God. And if this be Atheiſme, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it blaſphemy to ſay that Scripture onely is the rule of Chriſtian fayth, and that Chriſtians cannot be aſſured of any doctrine whereof they be not aſſured by the rule of Scripture onely.

IF the Church be an infallible guide in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, or which is all one, an infallible teacher of all neceſſary truth, then is ſhe a certaine So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of one denomination, of one obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſubiect to one viſible head, in fallible in all her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals. But the Church is ſuch an infallible teacher of all neceſſary truth, or ſuch a guide in fundamentals. In this argument both propoſitions are yours, and I ſhall ſet downe your words fully, whereby you not onely deliuer, but alſo demonſtrate them. The <hi>Major</hi> you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

                     <hi>ca.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 139. <hi>You must know, that there is a wide difference</hi> betwixt being infallible in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> and being <hi>an infallible guide in Fundamentals.</hi> 
                     <q>The former we grant, for it is no more but this, that there ſhall be a Church in the world for euer. But we vtterly deny the Church to be the later: for to ſay ſo, were <hi>to oblige our ſelues</hi> to find ſome certaine Society of men, of whome we might be certayne, that they neither do, nor can erre in fundamentals nor in declaring what is funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and what is not; and conſequently to make any Church an infallible guide in Fundamentals would be to make it infallible in all thinges ſhe propoſes to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued. This therefore we deny both to your Church, &amp; to all Churches of one denomination, that is indeed we deny it ſimply to any Church. For no Church can be fit to be a guide, but only a Church of ſome certain denomination. For otherwiſe no man can poſſibly know which is the true Church, but by a praeexamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the doctrine controuerted; and that were not to be guided by the Church to the true doctrine, but by the true doctrine to the Church. Heereafter therefore when you heare Proteſtants ſay, <hi>the Church is infallible in fundamentalls,</hi> you muſt not conceaue them, as if they meane, as you do, ſome Society of Chriſtians, which may be knowne by adhering to ſome one Head,</q> for example to the <hi>Pope or Biſhop of Conſtantinople &amp;c.</hi> Thus you deliuer the ſequells of this propoſition, <hi>the Church is an infallible guide in fundamentalls,</hi> which are in a word our whole Catholique doctrine about the Church: that if that propoſition be by you granted expreſsely and cleerely, yea proued inuincibly from Scripture, you muſt returne againe to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſe by your owne iudgment be damned to Hell; ſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

That ſhee ſhall be alwayes a Church infallible in Fundamentalls, we eaſily grant: for it comes to no more but this, that there ſhall be alwayes a Church. But that there ſhall be alwayes ſuch a Church which is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible guide in Fundamentalls, this we deny. For this cannot be without ſetling a knowne infallibility in ſome one knowne Society of Christians, as the</hi> Greeke, <hi>or the</hi> Roman, <hi>(or ſome other Church) by adhering to which guide, men might be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to belieue aright in all Fundamentalls. A man that were destitute of all meanes of communicating his thoughts to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, might yet in himſelfe, and to himſelfe be infallible, but he could not be a guide to others. A Man, or a Church that were inuiſible, ſo that none could know how to repayre to it for direction, could not be an infallible guide, and yet he might be vnto himſelfe infallible.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. In the words cited in the firſt place, you diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt a Church <hi>infallible in Fundamentals,</hi> and ſuch a Church as is an <hi>infallible guide in Fundamentals,</hi> granting the true Church to be the former, but not the later, ieſting at your Aduerſary, as though his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding them did argue in him want of ſuch <hi>an acute wyt,</hi> as you ſuppoſe your ſelfe to haue. But in the ſecond citations you <hi>do vs the fauour</hi> to be ſo <hi>acute,</hi> ſo perſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſo ſharpe-ſighted, as to penetrate into the very

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned in the Church; and that to grant the former to the Church and deny the later, were to deuide the Church from its very eſſence. For I hope you will not be ſo <hi>acute,</hi> as to diſtinguiſh betwixt an <hi>infallible guide in Fundamentals,</hi> and ſuch a Church as is alwayes in fact <hi>without fayle</hi> the teacher, the propoſer, the maintayner, in a word the miſtreſſe of all neceſſary truth euen by eſſence; that ſhe can no more depart from teaching, propoſing, and maintayning all fundamentall Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doctrine, then from her owne being. Nor do you onely ſo affirme the Churches eſſentiall infallibility in teaching all Fundamentals, but alſo prooue the ſame by the word of God, which propoſes the Church of Chriſt as the pillar and ground of truth, as built on the Rocke againſt which the gates of Hell ſhal neuer preuaile.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedly, vnanſwerably in the defence of the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, then you haue done, while you are perſwaded, that you plead againſt her, as appeareth by theſe Concluſions, the deduction whereof is confeſſed and expreſſed by your ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

This you grant in ſaying, that if the Church be an infallible guide in Fundamentals, then <hi>this knowne infallibility, must be ſetled in ſome knowne Society of Christians, by adhering to which guide men may be guided to belieue aright in all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals.

                  <p n="6">6. Secondly this Church being an infallible guide
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2514:64"/>in Fundamentals, muſt be likewyſe infallible in all her propoſals in matter of fayth. This ſequell, according to your good cuſtome, you both deny and grant. You deny it <hi>pag.</hi> 177. ſaying, <hi>that the Church, though ſhe be the ground and rocke of all neceſſary truth, yet not the rocke and ground, or infallible teacher of all profitable truth, but may erre and mainteyne damnable errour against it.</hi> But <hi>pag.</hi> 105. <hi>n.</hi> 139. you grant the Conſequence, ſaying, <hi>To grant any Church an infallible guide in Fundamentals, would be to make it infallible in all things which ſhe propoſes, and requires to be believed:</hi> and <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 36. you ſay, <hi>The Church except ſhe be infallible in all things we can belieue her in nothing vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her word and authority;</hi> which you proue by this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration vnanſwerably, <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſay you, <hi>an authority ſubiect to errour can be no firme and ſtable foundation of my beliefe in any thing. And if it were in any thing, then this authority being one &amp; the ſame in all propoſals, I ſhould haue the ſame reaſon to belieue all, that I haue to belieue one. And therefore must do vnreaſonably eyther in belieuing any one thing vpon the ſole warrant of this authority, or elſe in not</hi> belieuing <hi>all things aequally warranted by it.</hi> Behold how earneſtly you auerre and forcibly demonſtrate what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you did ſo peremptorily deny, that the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pillar and ground of ſome Truth, to wit of Truth neceſſary to Saluation, muſt of neceſſity be the pillar &amp; ground of all ſauing Truth; becauſe a Church ſubiect to errour in ſome things cannot be the ground and firme foundation of my beleefe in any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.</p>

                     <q>The former the Doctour togeather with the Article of the Church of <hi>England</hi> attributeth to the Church, and I ſubſcribe to this opinion, that is, an authority in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining Controuerſies of fayth, according to plain, and euident Scripture, and vniuerſall Tradition &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, ſo long as they proceed according to this rule.

I hope you will not deny, but that Iudges haue authority to determine cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall and ciuill Controuerſies; and yet I hope you wil not ſay, that they are abſolutely infallible in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations. <hi>Infallible,</hi> while they proceed according

                     </q> Thus you. Now let the Reader be Iudge whether it be not a thing in you both ridiculous and hatefull to be ſtill vanting of the ſubtilty of your wit, and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching want thereof to your Aduerſarie, whereas your ſubtilties be groſſe contradictions of your ſelfe, that I am euen amazed how any man could be ſo forgetfull and voyd of conſideration. You ſay, there is a wyde difference betweene authority to decide matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Infallibility in doing it; which you proue, becauſe Iudges haue authority to determine criminal and ciuill Controuerſies, and yet are not abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, but infallible only conditionally if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to law. Now this your ſubtility your ſelfe condemnes for ignorant folly, as not conſidering the wide difference betwixt Iudges in ciuill Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies, and Iudges with authority to determine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fayth: that the former may be fallible, but not the later.

Your other diſtinction alſo of Infallibility abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and conditionall, is a meere fopperie as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it: and by attributing only conditionall infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Church, you contradict your ſelfe.

How then can the Iudge in matters of Religion, endued with power to determine Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies of fayth, violate his duety, except you can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue that he that is infallible may fayle?

To make the Title good, we muſt declare &amp; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the definition and nature of Hereſy. Chriſtian fayth ſtands vpon two grounds or principles, <hi>diuine Reuelation,</hi> and the <hi>external Propoſition thereof;</hi> For we cannot by Chriſtian fayth belieue any thing which is not reuealed of God, nor what is reuealed of God is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible and worthy to be credited and belieued of vs, till the ſame be externally propoſed to vs by ſome credible witneſſe. For as we could not belieue the word of God, were not the Authour infinitely credible and worthy of credit; ſo likewiſe our perſwaſion cannot reſt firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the propoſition, that God hath reuealed ſuch thinges, except the Proponent be euidently credible of it ſelfe.

                  <hi>That our inquiſition of what is reuealed of God, neuer ceaſeth till at last we find a principle to be rested on for it ſelfe, which may be a rocke and ground vnto our beliefe.</hi> Hence there be
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2514:83"/>two Aduerſaries of Chriſtian fayth, Ethniciſme, and Hereſy: <hi>Ethniciſme</hi> oppoſeth and denieth expreſſely Chriſtian doctrine to be diuine reuelation, and calleth in queſtion the authority of God. <hi>Hereſy</hi> oppoſeth the authority of the Chriſtian <hi>Proponent</hi> of diuine Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and though he profeſſe to belieue Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines &amp; diuine reuelations, yet in the queſtion, which in particular they be, he will be his owne chooſer, as the word <hi>Hereſy</hi> doth declare, being in engliſh the ſame as <hi>Choyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Whoſoeuer then refuſeth to belieue any do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine propoſed to him by the laſt Chriſtian Principle and rule euidently credible of it ſelfe, ſuch a man is an Heretique, and to be accounted as a <hi>Heathen and Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.</hi> As whome we cannot make to ſee the light of the ſunne ſhinning at noone day, we leaue him for a blind man; whome we cannot make to apprehend the prime principles of reaſon euident of themſelues, we leaue him for a ſot, and vncapable of learning: So whome we cannot wyn to belieue, what is propoſed by the laſt and vttermoſt euidence, Chriſtian Propoſition can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly haue, we leaue him for <hi>wilfully blind,</hi> for one <hi>voyd of fayth,</hi> for a <hi>heathen and publican.</hi> For what can we do to him more?

               <p n="3">3. Some may ſay, if he ſee the doctrine to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in Scripture, and yet disbelieue it, then is he an Hereticke. I anſwere, then he is not an heretique, but a Heathen, openly and formally an Infidell. For you ſay

Some may alſo pretend, that an Hereticke is one, that erreth <hi>about ſome truth, which doth directly and eſſentially concerne matter of Saluation, though he ioyne not obſtinacy to his errour.</hi> But this is manifeſtly falſe. An Hereticke is one hatefull, horrible, and deteſtable, but a man that erreth in matters of ſaluation ignorantly for want of ſufficient inſtruction and propoſition, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerable and to be pittied, not to be abhorred. He that being in the darke ſeeth not the meate that is neere him, and ſo ſtarueth for want of food, cannot be ſaid to be a blind man, or a wilfull ſtaruer of himſelfe: ſo the Chriſtian who doth erre about ſome eſſentiall points of Saluation, the neceſſary food of the ſoule, &amp; ſo periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, becauſe the light of credibility doth not ſhine vpon it in reſpect of him, cannot be ſaid to be an Hereticke, or an Infidell, but only in this reſpect an vnhappy wretch; though this caſe among Chriſtians can hardly happen. Finally an Hereticke is one that erreth through inward indiſpoſition to belieue: but the man that doth disbelieue a truth, only becauſe he is not ſufficiently in ſtructed, may want no good diſpoſition and readines of mind to belieue; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he cannot be an Hereticke.</p>

So that in ciuill Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies euery honeſt vnderstanding man is fit to be a Iudge, but in Religion none but he that is infallible.</hi> Now ſeing you ſay <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 22. <hi>That in matters of Religion the office of Iudge may be giuen to none but whome God hath deſigned for it,</hi> a Generall Councell which hath the office of iudge to pronounce a Iudiciall obliging ſentence in matters of Religion, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:2514:95"/>be infallible, and bind Chriſtians not onely to outward ſubmiſſion; but alſo to belieue, that it hath iudged right and according to the word of God: Except you will ſay, that God doth aſſigne and authorize ſuch Iudges <hi>as are not ſit for the office,</hi> nor ſuch as the ſtate of Religion doth require. Beſides, to ſay that Generall Councels haue authority immediatly from Chriſt to bind all perſons to externall obedience, and yet that ſuch Councels be fallible, and falſe many times; what is it but to ſay, that Chriſt hath appoynted ſuch Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity &amp; gouernement in his Church, by the force wherof men are bound to diſſemble and play the Hypocrites in matters of Religion? For example, Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels haue defined, <hi>That Communion in one kind is lawfull</hi> &amp; command all Chriſtians to approue and practize it. You are perſuaded in conſcience, that this is vnlawfull, a ſacrilegious mayming of the Sacrament, and yet by your doctrine, <hi>That Councels bind at the leaſt to outward ſubmiſſion and externall obedience,</hi> you are bound out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to practiſe it, and to make a ſhew as if you did iudge the ſame lawfull. It is therefore euident truth (&amp; the contrary impious) that Generall Councels appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Chriſt, <hi>as the higheſt externall Tribunals the Church hath on earth, and which bind all perſons to externall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> are infallible.

For the reſt it is an heape of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſlanders, baſe calumniations ridiculous brags, vild, reproaches, concumelious ſpeachs againſt the Church, the Pope, the Ieſuits, and namely the Authour of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity mainsayned,</hi> wide miſtaking of the force of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries Arguments wild and exorbitant anſweres, his arguing vpon this falſe ſuppoſition pittifully <hi>begged,</hi> &amp; aſſumed <hi>gratis</hi> without (I will not ſay a <hi>Schillingworth,</hi> but) <hi>a Pennywarth of</hi> proofe, that our Religion is but the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:2514:98"/>Doctrine of the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi> his, <hi>the pure Word of God, the Bible, and onely the Bible.</hi> Theſe Arguments for multitude innumerable, and diffuſed by large extent ouer all the leaues, pages, and numbers of his booke, make it vnworthy to be read, and much more vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be, for all the particulars thereof, diſtinctly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and refuted.</p>

I alſo would haue him to know, that I keepe more then an hundred of his contradictions and groſſe ignorances in ſtore to beſtow on him for his reward, if he ſhal vndertake to reply. Theſe I omitted in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, not to cloy with ſuperfluities, the appetite of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Readers, who with the diſcouery of a few groſſe contradictions (ſuch as theſe be wherwith I haue char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him) remaine ſatisfyed, and <hi>filled</hi> with contempt of ſuch a writer. I likewiſe was fearefull leaſt by ſome, the cenſure of ſmall diſcretion might belayd vpon me, for ſpending ſo much time agaynſt ſuch an vnworthy wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, wherein the Authour himſelfe will not be able to ſhew three Pages together which be coherent, and not contradictious againſt other parts of his Booke.
